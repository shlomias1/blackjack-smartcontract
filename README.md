## About the Project

This project is an Ethereum-based smart contract for a game of Blackjack. The contract handles all the game logic, including shuffling cards, dealing hands, and determining the outcome of each round. Players interact with the contract through transactions, placing bets and receiving payouts based on the results of their games.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shlomias1/blackjack-smartcontract.git
   cd blackjack-smartcontract
### Install dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install

### Compile the smart contract

  ```sh
  truffle compile

### Deploy the smart contract to a local development network

  ```sh
  truffle migrate

### Usage

Run a local blockchain using Ganache.
Deploy the contract to the local blockchain.
Interact with the contract using a web3-enabled browser extension like MetaMask.
Smart Contract Details
Contract Architecture
The smart contract is designed to handle the core mechanics of the Blackjack game. It is divided into several components:

Card Handling: The contract ensures fair shuffling and dealing of cards.
Betting Mechanism: Players can place bets, which are locked until the game resolves.
Game Logic: The contract enforces Blackjack rules, such as hitting, standing, and determining the winner.
Payout: Based on the game outcome, the contract automatically transfers the appropriate amount of tokens to the winner.

### Key Features

Fairness: The contract uses cryptographic techniques to ensure the fairness of card shuffling.
Transparency: All actions are recorded on the blockchain, making the game outcomes fully transparent.
Security: The contract is designed with security in mind, preventing common vulnerabilities like re-entrancy attacks.

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command

truffle test

This will execute all the unit tests to ensure the smart contract behaves as expected.
